# eucalyptus-core

The core libraries of the eucalyptus editor. Great for embedding into `redback-runtime` and `eucalyptus-editor` as one big change instead of a bunch of features.

This is a library, so if tools are wished to be made, this is the perfect library for you.

it also produces a shared library for Kotlin/Native and the JVM :)
