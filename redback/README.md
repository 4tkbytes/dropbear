# redback

This is the cli build system (+ library) used by games made with the Eucalyptus game editor.

It compiles all the assets in a ready to ship package, with all your scripts, resources, shaders compiled 
and batteries included.

The project is named after the Redback Spider, which is a highly venomous spider from Australia, but also a spider to "glue". 

<!-- ## State

Currently, this tool is name-squatting until the Eucalyptus game engine is in primitive completion state (basic features done, but not ready to ship out). This may take about a year (maybe).  -->
