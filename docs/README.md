# Rhai Reference

This part of the documentation is to show the different components, structs and functions available to you for scripting with the Rhai Language on the Eucalyptus editor.

Before you start, ensure you get a rough idea of how the Rhai language works. Kindly enough, the maintainer of the project has decided to add documentation.
